[[Dean of Engineering]] [[Harold Lampe]] merged the departments of [[ceramic engineering]], [[geological engineering]], and the [[metallurgy program]] in [[mechanical engineering]] to become the new [[Department of Mineral Industries]]. [[William W. Austin]] was head of  this new [[department]]. Separate degree programs were retained in ceramics, geology, and metallurgy. A departmental memo from 1954 states, "the merger has been made because it is felt that an integration of talents and physical facilities of the three areas will result in the most effective and efficient operation."
