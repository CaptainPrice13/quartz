[[A. F. Greaves-Walker]] published a 6-part series of bulletins through the [[Engineering Experiment Station]] that outlined the need for developing and investing in North Carolina minerals. The bulletins described "the location of the deposits and enumerate the possible uses of various minerals, with the hope that North Carolinians may be interested in developing new mineral industries during the post-war period." The bulletins advocated investing efforts to develop and retain these resources locally, particularly during the years following [[1939 - World War II Starts]].
