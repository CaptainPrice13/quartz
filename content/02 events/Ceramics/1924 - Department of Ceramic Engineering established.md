[[A. F. Greaves-Walker]] organized and served as head of the new [[Department of Ceramic Engineering]], the first department of its kind in the American South. [[Greaves-Walker]] was from the U.K. and spent 20 years working in industry as a mining and ceramic engineer and administrator. According to a 1927 _Technician_ article, the department was "established primarily to promote the ceramic industries of North Carolina and to thus provide plants in which its graduates may find employment."
