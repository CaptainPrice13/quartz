In 1969, the department was renamed to the Department of Materials Engineering, with William W. Austin remaining as head of the department. In accordance with national trends in the field at this time, the distinct degree programs in ceramic engineering and metallurgy were dissolved, and the emphasis of the program changed “from the exploitation of raw materials to discovering and applying fundamental relationships that exist between the hyperfine structures of solids and their engineering properties.”

As the department of Materials Engineering entered the 1970s, faculty in the department remained engaged in ongoing extension activities throughout the state.  Dr. Charles Manning and Dr. John C. Hurt taught college credit courses in Materials Factors in Design for technical and engineering personnel at the Naval Air Rework Station in Cherry Point, NC, and in Wilmington, NC. Negotiations were initiated to develop a graduate extension program in Wilmington, NC, with emphasis on materials for technical and scientific personnel of companies in the area, such as the General Electric Nuclear Power Division; the program was not approved, but resulted in the creation of a series of resident evening and weekend courses for workers in industry who wished to continue their education in the field of materials. In 1970 NC State also hosted the 15th annual Clay Plant Operators’ Forum, co-sponsored by NC State University, Clemson University, and the brick and tile service associations of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia. The 1970 meeting drew 275 industry representatives from 33 states and two foreign countries and was “extremely well received,” providing an opportunity for “improved communications with and services to this important industry.”[^3] Dr. George O. Harrell was heavily involved in organizing and managing the forums on behalf of the department at NC State.

In 1970 the Materials Engineering department also co-hosted the Research Conference on Severe Environments with NASA, the US Army Research Office in Durham, NC, and the US Air Force Aerospace Research Laboratories. Drs. W.W. Kriegel and Hayne Palmour III co-edited the publication "Ceramics in Severe Environments" (1972) as a result of the conference proceedings. Hayne Palmour III, Robert F. Davis, and T.M. Hare organized an annual Conference on the Processing of Crystalline Ceramics beginning in 1964 that continued through the late 1970s and drew leading ceramists from the United States and abroad.

Research activities in the 1970s began focusing on “societal problems” such as housing, pollution, health, and medicine in applications-oriented research activities, in alignment with areas of research receiving more substantial support.[[6]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn6)  The undergraduate and graduate curricula also underwent some updating to become "more relevant to the current emphases on the environmental aspects of materials," that dealt with pollution control and the effects of materials and processes on the environment. Beginning in 1972, new undergraduate courses were introduced to address environmental issues including Materials and the Environment, Environmental Aspects of Materials Processing, and Materials and Civilization.[[7]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn7) In the late 1970s, research areas in the Materials Science and Engineering also began to expand into microelectronic materials. The department established a partnership with the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina in Research Triangle Park.[[8]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn8)

Maintaining the department’s close relationships with the Asheville Minerals Research Laboratory and the Industrial Extension Service was part of its continued extension activities.  In 1970 Dr. George O. Harrell was engaged in collaboration with the Industrial Extension Service in a project on the use of mineral products as fillers and extenders in plastics, paper, and other materials. The project held the potential to expand the market for North Carolina minerals, of benefit to the industrial economy of the state “by serving both producers and consumers of these materials.”[[9]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn9) Other “short term industry problems” were frequently referred to the department by the Industrial Extension Service personnel, or were received through the department’s direct contact with the industry.[[10]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn10)

In 1971 the Engineering Research Department was renamed the Engineering Research Services Division, and served as the research division for the Materials Engineering department [exclusively?]. R.F. Stoops remained head of the division until 1981.

The Mining Act of 1971 reflected growing efforts to influence environmentally sound practices in the mineral industries in North Carolina.  The Mining Act was introduced on April 8, 1971, to the North Carolina General Assembly to “allow the mining of valuable materials” while also providing for the protection and restoration of the “usefulness, productivity, and scenic values of all lands and waters involved in mining within the State.”[[11]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn11) The Act required any operator to obtain an operating permit in order to engage in any mining activities on an area of one acre or more, and required permits to be renewed every ten years. Permits would be denied if mining operations were deemed likely to have any adverse effects on wildlife, fisheries, water and air quality, or any surrounding buildings, parks, forests, or recreation areas.[[12]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn12)

During this same year, the Mining and Minerals Resources Research Act, sponsored by Congressman John P. Saylor of Pennsylvania, was gaining momentum in the United States Congress. The proposed bill would appropriate funds to one land grant university in each state to support research and training of mineral engineers.[[13]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn13) Hayne Palmour III of the Department of Engineering Research and C.J. Leith, head of the Department of Geosciences, wrote a letter to representatives in Congress in November 1971 outlining their support of the bill. Palmour and Leith highlighted the challenges of a land grant university to keep up with the growing need for research and development in the mineral industries, and pointed out the unique challenges in North Carolina in light of new environmental protections introduced in the Mining Act of 1971: “New technologies and qualified technical leaders for research, development, and application efforts are not now available in sufficient strength to permit North Carolina’s primary producers to meet stringent new regulations regarding air and water pollution, mine safety, and land reclamation.”[[14]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn14) Their argument further pointed to the need to support mineral industries in adapting to changing economic patterns and increasing foreign competition by building “technical manpower and new knowledge about processes” for mining and minerals resources.[[15]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn15) The bill was enacted in 1973 and authorized a disbursement of $200,000 to each state in the first year and increased funding in subsequent years, “for the purpose of assisting each State in carrying on the work of a competent and qualified mining and mineral resources research institute, or equivalent agency at certain colleges or universities in such State.”[[16]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn16) The bill required any Federal funds disbursed to be matched by non-Federal funds, and encouraged institutions to arrange for collaborative studies and experiments across disciplines, departments, and institutions.[[17]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn17)

By 1975, active research contracts in the department of Materials Engineering reached a total of $621,806, supporting the “particularly productive” activities of Drs. Beeler, Benson, Davis, Fahmy, Manning, and Mayer.  Research activities in 1975-1976 resulted in 39 “highly significant” technical reports and publications, and supported research assistantships for thirteen graduate students.[[18]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn18)  Agencies supporting faculty research grants and contracts included the Army Research Office, Office of Naval Research, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Institute, the North Carolina Board of Science and Technology, and the Alcoa Foundation of Pittsburgh, PA.[[19]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn19)

In the early 1970s, the department began to update its graduate program to encourage interdisciplinary cooperation and collaboration through cross listing of graduate courses and joint appointments of faculty. A focus on supporting interdisciplinary collaboration and teaching and research was echoed in university-wide Self Study Report for accreditation review by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1971.[[20]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn20)

In 1973, Aziza Ragal El-Lozy became first woman to receive Ph.D. degree in Materials Engineering.

[![Leon T. Jordan, playing a glass trumpet](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/sites/default/files/files/images/UA023.024.021_0010638.jpg)](https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/0010638)  
_[Leon T. Jordan, playing a glass trumpet.](https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/0010638) ([UA023.024](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/findingaids/ua023_024))_

In 1977, Dr. Leon Jordan, a faculty member in Materials Engineering and University Studies, coordinated a new sequence of technical courses in Engineering Operations that focused on the engineering and manufacture of musical instruments. The proposed program was a result of collaborative efforts between the Music Department, University Studies, the School of Forest Resources, the Department of Materials Engineering, and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and the Engineering Operations Division, to “foster an interaction between music and the sciences” and to provide education for students interested in the technical aspects of musical instrument manufacture.[[21]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn21)  While NC State did not offer a music degree, in 1977 the Music Department offered courses taken by over 950 students enrolled throughout the eight schools of the university.  Dr. Jordan remarked that as a large engineering school with highly qualified faculty in materials science, wood science, technology, the physical sciences, and acoustical studies, “NC State is in a unique position to provide a research atmosphere for the development of new materials and new techniques for manufacturing musical instruments.”[[22]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn22)

Dr. Jordan brought Dr. Robert A. Moog, inventor of the Moog synthesizer, to give a lecture at NC State in February of 1981, titled “Synthetic Sound and Real Music,” as part of a two-day visit to campus arranged through the Engineering Operations Program and the Division of University Studies.[[23]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn23) The visit was intended as an opportunity to explore the intersection of physics, electrical engineering, and music in the form of electronic musical instruments.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act to provide funding for land grant universities engaged in minerals research and education to conduct “a program of substantial instruction and research in mining or minerals extraction.”[[24]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn24)  The Materials Engineering Department responded by developing a formal proposal for establishing a federally funded minerals institute program on the NC State campus.[[25]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn25)  H.B. Smith was assigned to develop a Minerals Engineering Program at NC State, due to his work as Director of the Minerals Research Laboratory and as Chairman of the North Carolina Mining Commission. In a report by Smith, he outlines an “urgent need” for minerals research and engineers “at a time when the universities’ minerals programs have reached a deplorable state, both in terms of education and research.”[[26]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn26)

Smith noted that NC State was in a unique position as a possible recipient of funding from the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. While the “cooperative relationships of the Minerals Research Laboratory with industry, the University, and the North Carolina Earth Resources Department are regarded as outstanding by others in the minerals field,” and the laboratory was highly productive in terms of research serving faculty and students in the departments of Materials, Chemical, Civil, and Nuclear Engineering at NC State, the university did not have a “named academic unit awarding degrees with majors in mining and minerals engineering.”[[27]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn27) For this reason, Smith concluded, the committee deciding eligibility in the legislation was likely to find NC State “inadequate with respect to its educational programs in mining and minerals engineering.”[[28]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn28)

In response to Smith’s report, W.W. Austin, head of the Department of Materials Engineering, drafted a proposal for establishing a mineral engineering program in the Materials Engineering department at a projected cost of $110,000. Austin concluded that in the face of “the increasing urgency of optimizing the conservation and utilization of mineral resources,” the department would modify its existing undergraduate curriculum to provide a degree program or specialty option in Mineral Engineering. The proposed modification would “place stronger emphasis on, and give visibility to, the area of Mineral Engineering” through the establishment of specific courses and a named designation of this specialty area.[[29]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn29)

By 1979, declining numbers of partnerships with the ceramics industry in North Carolina became an issue requiring “serious attention” in the department of Materials Engineering.  Due to alleged “neglect… and deterioration of the ceramic specialization of the department,” a departmental report warned that “the ceramic industry of the State is, in general, quite disenchanted with the Department” and was directing research partnerships toward Clemson University instead of NC State.[[30]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn30) Appointing at least two young ceramic engineers to the faculty of the department was identified as a priority.  This issue was partially resolved by 1982, when the Ceramic Engineering Option was re-instated with the addition of Dr. Richard Porter and former personnel of the Engineering Research Services Division.  In 1982, the department reported that more students were selecting the Ceramic Engineering Option due to the renewed assurance that the courses offered in this option would be taught on a regular basis.[[31]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn31)

Following W.W. Austin's retirement in 1979, Henry B. Smith became acting head of the department (1979-1980) followed by James K. Magor (1980-1981), before the arrival of Hans Conrad as Materials Engineering Department Head in 1981. Conrad was born in Germany and came to the United States at the age of three years old when his father secured a job with Ford in Michigan. Conrad held a B.S. in Metallurgical Engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later Carnegie Mellon), and an M.S. and Ph.D. in Metallurgy from Yale University. He worked for the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) during World War II to develop an aluminum alloy for use in aircraft that is still in use in the 21st century.  Dr. Conrad continued working in industry for over twenty years until joining the faculty and becoming head of the Department of Metallurgical Engineering at the University of Kentucky in 1967.  He came to NC State as head of the Materials Engineering Department and held this position from 1981-1985, and continued teaching at NC State until 1993.[[32]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn32) In 1985 he spent a year as Distinguished Visiting Professor at the American University in Cairo, Egypt. Over the five years that Dr. Conrad served as head of the department he oversaw “major improvements” including revised undergraduate curriculum, improved laboratory space and equipment, the addition of seven new faculty members, an increase in research expenditures by a factor of 10, and substantial progress toward establishing a strong microelectronics teaching and research program.[[33]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn33)

Dr. Conrad’s research focused on metals throughout most of his career, including multiple aerospace projects for the government and private industry, and shifted toward ceramics in the 2000s.  In 2010 he partnered with postdoctoral researcher Di Yang to find that ceramics can be made stronger, at lower temperatures and more quickly, by placing the raw materials in a weak electrical field, requiring much less energy to produce.[[34]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn34)

1981 was described as a “landmark year” for the department and kicked off a period of growth and change in the department, as part of “the Department’s plan to become the best Department in the southeastern United States and soon after to become one of the very best in the United States.” Efforts to achieve this goal were seen in the addition of new faculty and staff, improved and expanding academic and research programs, and the assimilation of the former Engineering Research Services Division into the department.[[35]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn35) 

Historically, as noted in a 1957 report by W.W. Austin, teaching departments, such as the Department of Materials Engineering, assumed responsibility for technical aspects of research, while the Department of Engineering Research, which included the Minerals Research Laboratory, handled contractual administration, reporting, and project development.[[36]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn36) This changed in 1981 when the Engineering Research Services Division merged with the department of Materials Engineering.  The former ERSD personnel were paid from funds appropriated for research and were designated “research faculty,” as distinct from “teaching faculty.” This distinction was eliminated by appointing all faculty members from combined teaching and research funds, in alignment with the principle that “all faculty members are expected to teach and to be involved in research.” [[37]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn37)

[![MAVAC computer](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/sites/default/files/files/images/UA012012000_0016860.jpg)](https://d.lib.ncsu.edu/collections/catalog/0016860)

A growing focus on electronic materials and computers appears in the department’s 1981-1982 annual report: “The faculty believes that it is imperative that computers be more widely used in the Department’s academic and research programs.”[[38]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn38) To support this, Dr. Joe Beeler developed a set of computer programs and produced a report on Computer Aided Teaching in Materials Engineering; Dr. Beeler and Dr. Thomas Hare recommended that faculty and students in the department become more involved in using computers classrooms and labs.  A revised undergraduate curriculum in 1983 required an advanced-level computer course in the first semester of junior year. An Electronic Materials Option was established in the curriculum in 1982, and a Microelectronic Materials Option was in place by 1983.[[39]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn39) 

The quality of teaching labs for Materials Engineering improved in 1983 when the department moved from Page Hall to Riddick Hall and the Burlington Engineering Laboratory, gaining valuable space “that was designed specifically for the type of teaching laboratories the Department needs.”  Dean of Engineering Larry Monteith gave $75,000, with a commitment of $150,000, to equip the labs.[[40]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn40)  While the additional space was an asset, many of the undergraduate teaching laboratories were not operational since the move from Page Hall due to lack of modern research equipment and insufficient operating funds, issues that were highlighted in a 1984 annual report.[[41]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn41) The need for equipment was partially resolved in 1986 through a significant donation of two major pieces of equipment from the Electronic Materials Division of Monsanto Corporation, secured by NC State Professor George Rozgonyi.[[42]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn42)

Efforts to promote interdisciplinary collaborations resulted in Materials Engineering faculty voting to invite members of other departments in the School of Engineering to become Associate Faculty in the Materials Engineering Department. Dr. Kerry S. Havner of Civil Engineering, Dr. John A. Bailey of Mechanical Engineering, and Dr. Yasuyuki of Civil Engineering, who worked on a sponsored research program with Hayne Palmour III, were invited as Associate Faculty in Materials Engineering “because of their outstanding activities in the field of materials.”[[43]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn43)  The number of these interdepartmental appointments grew in the coming years to include Associate Faculty from the departments of Chemistry, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and the Minerals Research Laboratory.[[44]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn44) Research programs expanded to support interdisciplinary projects, such as an IBM-funded joint project with faculty from Electrical and Computer Engineering at NC State on “AlGaAs Short Wavelength Lasers Grown by MBE,” and a joint project with faculty in Electrical Engineering at Duke University, “Oxygen Precipitation in Silicon: The Role of Point Defects and Thermal History,” funded by the Monsanto Company.[[45]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn45)

During the early 1980s recruiting efforts focused on increasing diversity in the department’s faculty and student population. Dr. James K. Magor and Dr. Leon Jordan were heavily involved in outreach efforts to recruit African American students to the School of Engineering through the Upward Bound in Engineering and Technology Program and the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering Program.  In 1981, Dr. Jordan made at least ten presentations to high school students in the Upward Bound program, and conducted laboratory demonstrations on the physical properties of matter for groups of high school students participating in the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering Program, designed to generate interest in engineering among black high school students.[[46]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn46)  In 1982 there were no African American faculty in the department, with the explanation that “there are so few black materials engineers.”  The department launched recruiting efforts by writing to Materials Engineering graduate programs throughout the country and placing advertisements in prominent materials engineering journals, but the efforts were not fruitful. A statement in a 1982 annual report acknowledged that, “the administration is conscious of its obligations concerning minorities, and will continue to try to find qualified minority candidates for vacant positions.”[[47]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn47)

Efforts were also focused toward increasing diversity in the department by seeking more women faculty.  Dr. Debra DeSimone-Maracas joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor in 1982, and was the only female member of the department’s faculty at that time.  Dr. DeSimone-Maracas developed the department’s first course in Microelectronic Materials, and launched the department’s Microelectronic Materials Option.[[48]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn48)

In 1982, the Minerals and Materials Research Program (MMRP) was established as the unit responsible for all of the department’s research and extension activities, with Hans Conrad as its Director.  A primary function of the MMRP was to train graduate students in research, as “most of the applied research performed in fulfilling the Department’s responsibilities for promoting the technical development of North Carolina’s industries and utilization of the State’s natural resources” was not deemed “suitable for training graduate students.[[49]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn49)  While the MMRP was established to support the Materials Engineering Department, it was also intended to support interdisciplinary activities as a “mechanism for joint project development among various departments in engineering, in other schools on campus, and at other universities in the state and region.”[[50]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn50) 

In 1984, the Materials Research Center was established. Faculty from the Chemistry, Physics, and Electrical and Computer Engineering Departments had collaborated with the Materials Engineering Department to prepare a proposal for the National Science Foundation to establish a dedicated laboratory for materials research on the NC State campus in 1983. The NSF did not accept the proposal, but University funding was obtained to start the research center. Plans were announced in 1984 to place the MRC in the Burlington Engineering Laboratory Building once renovated, and to appoint Robert Davis as its first Director.[[51]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn51)

In 1985, John .J. Hren became head of the Department of Materials of Engineering. Hren studied Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Wisconsin, University of Illinois, and Stanford, and taught from 1965-1985 at the University of Florida Gainesville, where he was founding director of a major analytical instrumentation center.  Hren joined the faculty at NC State in 1985 and served as head of the department from 1985-1998.  Over the course of his career he received prestigious fellowships including two Fulbright Fellowships at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Portugal in 1980, and at the Institute Josef Stevan in Slovenia in 1998. 

The Engineering Research Services Division separated from the Materials Engineering Department in 1986 and formed a new entity called the Analytical Instrumentation Facility (AIF), with P.E. Russell as its first Director.  The Materials Engineering Department Head, Dr. Hren, was made a member of the board of directors and given specific responsibility for the personnel and equipment associated with materials characterization and analysis.[[52]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn52)  The AIF was later placed on Centennial Campus in the Monteith Research Center, to support research and extension work in the College of Engineering.

Under Dr. Hren’s leadership, the department was renamed to the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and became involved in the design of research facilities on Centennial Campus. In July 1986, as a result of successful advocacy by Dr. Hren and others, the name of the Department of Materials Engineering was changed officially to Materials Science and Engineering. The new name reflected “the dual nature of known routes to success within the materials disciplines by maintaining expertise in both science and engineering, consistent with recent trends among the nation’s materials-oriented academic institutions.”[[53]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn53)

In 1987, Cree, the world's first manufacturer of energy-saving blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), was established.  Three of the company’s four founders, Eric Hunter, John Palmour, and Calvin Carter attended undergraduate and graduate school in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at NC State, and studied under Professor Robert Davis.  As graduate students at NC State, Dr. Palmour, Dr. Carter, and Dr. Hunter conducted research on the high-temperature silicon carbide material while under Dr. Davis. In 1988 Dr. Palmour explained that the silicon carbide highest recorded operating temperature was 650 degrees Celsius, allowing it to operate at higher temperatures with less cooling systems than would typically be required. He stated that “the high temperature diodes, as well as the transistors, have applications not only in jet engines, but also in automobile engine systems,” and that blue LED’s with applications for digital color imaging would become commercially available in the late 1980s.[[54]](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/scrc/departmental-history-mse/mse-1986#_ftn54)
